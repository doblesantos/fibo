# Fibonacci Rest API with RoR

this api is implementation of the fibonnaci algoritm in rails 
if you want to test this api clone the repo and do a rails s then
post to the endpoint /fibo with the json {"index": X}
where X is any natural number

this was made in rails for the agile development, in future version maybe i will add frontend to this and maybe i can cache previus calculations using redis also i can deploy it to heroku
